# SCM : Software Configuration Management

SCM means managing software changes systemically. (I'm not so sure of using word "systemically" but I ment to say managing with fixed rules.) This includes version management, source management, build management or also release management. Which means that SCM is the process of management from the starting to the end of the development. 

I don't find SCM easy or simple neither. But the reason we need this difficult management system is because it helps us in many ways. Such as Backup, Compatibility, Cooperating.

## Version Management

### Semantic Versioning 

Version classified with Major, Minor and Patch. And this is upgraded by following condition.

Major : When current version is not compatible with previous version.

Minor : When current version is compatible with previous version but new function is added.

Patch : When current version is compatible with previous version and bug is fixed.

# OkHttp3'

This is a library that helps 

## Interceptor

It is of course a important but there is only one class that must be implemented in this class which is intercept(Interceptor.Chain chain) class

According to square.github.io explaination of interface Interceptor, it is written "Typically interceptors add, remove, and transform header on the request or response." And sadly since I dont's know the exact meaning of response and request, I will just consider it that request is a action that client want from server and response as a reply for client.

### Response interceptor (Interceptor.Chain chain) 

Throws : IOException

The return type of this class is a another object named Response. Let's also know the details of it XD (written below)

## Interceptor.Chain



## Request

## Request.Builder

## Response

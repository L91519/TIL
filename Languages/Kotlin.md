+ # Kotlin

  2020.01.07, today I handed my resignation. It's kinda meaningful day to me. I made my mind to study Kotlin real hard, and started writing. I hope that this would last long XD. 
  
  
  
  This Document will be mostly written in English.
  
  + Writing docs in English might be helpful in naming
  + Being familiar with programming terminologies
  + Being used to read English docs 
  
  ## Base Grammar
  
  Kotlin supports Type Interface. So programmars don't have to write types for each variable.
  
  ### Variable and Function
  
  #### Function
  
  Function properties
  
  + Declare function with "fun" keyword
  
  + Write parameter type after parameter name
  
  + Function can be declared out of class
  
  + Semicolon unnecessary
  
  + Distinguishing statement and expression : Unlike java, except for statement, all control structure is expression.
  
    Control structure : 제어 구조, 중괄호로 둘러쌓인 것
  
  + Expression can be used as function body
  
    ```kotlin
    fun max(a: Int, b: Int): Int = if(a > b) a else b
    fun max(a: Int, b: Int) = if(a > a) a else b
    ```

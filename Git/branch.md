# Branch

Branch is uesd when we cooperate a project with team members who take different part.

So each one can work on their own

Master is the final branch which all the branch should be merged.

## commands

#### git checkout testing

- This allows us to move to another branch.
- So in upper case, when we use 'git checkout testing', we can move to another branch which name is 'testing'

#### git checkout -b android

+ When we clone a project, only master branch will be created in our local folder. 


+ This comman will create a new branch in local area which branch's name is 'android' and checkout.
+ we nee following command to push branch to git. (git push origin shoppin_cart) And because the name of a branch in git and local equals to each other, no problem!! (maybe :^))
